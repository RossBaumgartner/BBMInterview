Basic interview exercise from starting at BBM
Interview Coding Data

For the coding interview component, we have been asking candidates to build from scratch a simple app.

The app is to show a list of cells that contain data from this webpage.

Each cell should display an avatar and one text string associated with the same data element.

The test has no right/wrong answer, it is aimed to discover the candidates familiarity with the iOS/Android tools and gauge their proficiency in coding for the platform. It is also a good opportunity to gauge how well they work with our team in a collaborative environment.

Candidates are free to use online resources, third party libraries and Google to help in the task. Also if they are stuck it may be good to give them hints, or simplify the problem. For example only show the text and ignore the image loading for the avatar.
